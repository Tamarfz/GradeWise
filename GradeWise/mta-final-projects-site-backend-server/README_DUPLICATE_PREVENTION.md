# Duplicate Prevention Implementation

## Overview
This implementation prevents the same project from being assigned to the same judge twice.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Validation (admin.router.js)
- **Pre-assignment check**: Validates existing assignments before creating new ones
- **Grade duplication check**: Ensures no duplicate grades exist for the same project-judge combination
- **Clear error messages**: Shows exactly which project-judge combination is duplicated

### 2. Database Constraints (add_unique_constraints.js)
- **Unique index on grades collection**: Prevents duplicate project_id + judge_id combinations
- **Unique index on projects_judges_groups**: Prevents duplicate assignment groups

### 3. Frontend Error Handling (assign-projects.js)
- **Error display**: Shows backend error messages to users
- **User feedback**: Clear indication when assignment fails

## How to Run

### 1. Add Database Constraints
```bash
cd mta-final-projects-site-backend-server
node scripts/add_unique_constraints.js
```

### 2. Restart Backend Server
The new validation logic is already in place and will work immediately.

## What Happens Now

### ✅ **Allowed:**
- Assign Project A to Judge 1
- Assign Project B to Judge 1
- Assign Project A to Judge 2

### ❌ **Blocked:**
- Assign Project A to Judge 1 (when already assigned)
- Error message: "Project A is already assigned to Judge 1. Cannot assign the same project to the same judge twice."

## Error Messages

- **Duplicate assignment**: Clear message showing which project-judge combination already exists
- **Database constraint violation**: MongoDB will also prevent duplicates at the database level
- **User-friendly feedback**: Frontend displays errors in a user-friendly way

## Benefits

1. **Data integrity**: No duplicate assignments possible
2. **Fair distribution**: Each judge gets unique projects
3. **Clear feedback**: Users know exactly why assignment failed
4. **Multiple protection layers**: Both application and database level prevention
